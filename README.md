### About Me
Heya! I'm **Nathan**, a 16-year-old developer who loves making cool stuff come alive with code 
I started my journey with **Java** and **Python**, and now I’m diving into **C++** and learning **C#** along the way.  
Coding is my playground — whether it’s automating something, building a game, or breaking my code just to fix it again.

---

### Languages & Tools
- **Java** – my main weapon of choice  
- **Python** – for automation, scripting and experimenting
- **C++** – when I feel like punishing myself in style  
- **C#** – currently learning and loving it!  
- **Git / GitHub**, **VS Code**, **IntelliJ IDEA**, **Visual Studio**

---

### Current Goals
- Level up my **C#** and .NET skills  
- Build a few fun open-source projects  
- Explore **game dev** and **backend systems**

---

### Fun Facts
- I talk to my compiler more than people sometimes  
- My sleep schedule and debug logs are equally messy  
- Fuel: Caffeine
