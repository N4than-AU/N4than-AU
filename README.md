### About Me

Hey! I'm **Nathan**, a 16-year-old developer who likes making random ideas turn into working projects.
I started with **Java** and **Python**, and now I’m also trying out **C++** and learning **C#**.
I enjoy coding a lot — some days I make cool stuff, some days I break everything and fix it again 😭.

---

### Languages & Tools

* **Java** – my main one
* **Python** – for scripts and quick stuff
* **C++** – for when I want a challenge
* **C#** – learning it right now
* I use **Git/GitHub**, **VS Code**, **IntelliJ**, **Visual Studio**

---

### Current Goals

* Get better at **C#**
* Make some fun open-source projects
* Try more **game dev** and backend projects

---

### Fun Facts

* I talk to my compiler way too much
* I helped fix two bugs in [Submerged](https://github.com/SubmergedAmongUs/Submerged)
* My sleep schedule is basically caffeine
* My debug logs look like a crime scene 💀
