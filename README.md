### 🚀 About Me
Heya! I'm **Nathan**, a 16-year-old developer who loves making cool stuff come alive with code 😎  
I started my journey with **Java** and **Python**, and now I’m diving into **C++** and learning **C#** along the way.  
Coding is my playground — whether it’s automating something, building a game, or breaking my code just to fix it again 😂

### 🧰 Languages & Tools
- ☕ **Java** – my main weapon of choice  
- 🐍 **Python** – for automation, scripting and experimenting
- 💪 **C++** – when I feel like punishing myself in style  
- ⚙️ **C#** – currently learning and loving it!  
- 🧑‍💻 **Git / GitHub**, **VS Code**, **IntelliJ IDEA**, **Visual Studio**

---

### 🔥 Current Goals
- 🧩 Level up my **C#** and .NET skills  
- 🧠 Build a few fun open-source projects  
- 🌐 Explore **game dev** and **backend systems**

### 🎮 Fun Facts
